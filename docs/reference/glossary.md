# Glossary

## AC (Allele Count)

Number of copies of the alternate allele observed across eligible samples. A heterozygous carrier contributes 1; a homozygous alt carrier contributes 2. See [Key Concepts](../getting-started/concepts.md#allele-frequency-ac-an-af).

## AF (Allele Frequency)

Ratio of AC to AN (`AC / AN`). Represents the proportion of alleles that are the alternate allele among eligible samples. Returns `None` when AN=0. See [Key Concepts](../getting-started/concepts.md#allele-frequency-ac-an-af).

## AN (Allele Number)

Total number of alleles examined across eligible samples. For autosomes, AN = 2 × number of eligible diploid samples. For sex chromosomes, AN depends on ploidy. See [Ploidy & Sex Chromosomes](../advanced/ploidy-and-sex-chroms.md).

## Bitmap

See [Roaring Bitmap](#roaring-bitmap).

## Bucket

A 1 Mbp (1,000,000 base pair) genomic interval used to partition variant data within each chromosome. Bucket 0 covers positions 0–999,999; bucket 1 covers 1,000,000–1,999,999; and so on. See [Data Model](data-model.md).

## Carrier

A sample that has at least one copy of the alternate allele at a given position (heterozygous or homozygous alt). Use `variant-info` to list carriers with their metadata. See [Variant Info](../guides/variant-info.md).

## Capture Index

An interval tree (stored as a `.pkl` file) built from a BED file that defines the genomic regions covered by a whole-exome sequencing (WES) technology. Used to determine which WES samples are eligible at a given position. WGS samples do not require a capture index. See [Key Concepts](../getting-started/concepts.md#capture-index-wes).

## Eligible Sample

A sample that passes all query filters (sex, phenotype, technology) and has coverage at the queried position. Only eligible samples contribute to AC and AN. See [Sample Filtering](../guides/sample-filtering.md).

## N_FAIL

The count of eligible samples whose call at a position had FILTER≠PASS in the source VCF. These samples are excluded from AC, but they remain eligible and so still count toward AN. See [FILTER=PASS Tracking](../advanced/filter-pass-tracking.md).

## N_NO_COVERAGE

The count of eligible samples whose tech lacks coverage evidence at this position. Excluded from `N_HOM_REF` to keep AC/AN conservative. Always `0` unless a coverage-evidence filter (`--min-pass`, `--min-observed`, `--min-quality-evidence`, or build-time `--min-covered`) is active. See [Coverage Evidence](../advanced/coverage-evidence.md).

## Manifest

A TSV file that maps each sample to its VCF path, sex, sequencing technology, and phenotype codes. The manifest drives database creation and is parsed into `metadata.sqlite`. See [Manifest Format](../guides/manifest-format.md).

## Metadata Code

Legacy term. See [Phenotype Code](#phenotype-code).

## Parquet

A columnar storage format used by AFQuery to store variant bitmaps on disk. Each Parquet file covers one bucket within one chromosome and contains rows sorted by `(pos, alt)`. See [Data Model](data-model.md).

## Phenotype Code

An arbitrary string label assigned to a sample in the manifest (e.g., ICD-10 codes, HPO terms, project tags). Multiple codes per sample are supported. Phenotype codes enable cohort stratification at query time. See [Key Concepts](../getting-started/concepts.md#the-metadata-model).

## Ploidy

The number of allele copies at a given locus, which depends on chromosome type and sex. Autosomes are diploid (ploidy=2) for all samples. chrX non-PAR is haploid for males, diploid for females. See [Ploidy & Sex Chromosomes](../advanced/ploidy-and-sex-chroms.md).

## Roaring Bitmap

A compressed bitset data structure that efficiently stores sets of integers. AFQuery uses Roaring Bitmaps (via the `pyroaring` library) to represent which samples carry a given genotype. Typical compression: ~2 bytes per sample per variant. See [roaringbitmap.org](https://roaringbitmap.org/).

## Schema Version

The AFQuery database format version stored in `manifest.json` — `2.0`, or `3.0` when the database was built with coverage-quality filters. See [Data Model](data-model.md).

## Technology

The sequencing platform or assay type assigned to a sample (e.g., `wgs`, `wes_v1`, `panel_cardiac`). Determines capture index eligibility and enables technology-stratified queries. See [Technology Integration](../use-cases/technology-integration.md).
