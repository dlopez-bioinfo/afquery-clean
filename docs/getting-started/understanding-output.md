# Understanding Output

This page explains what each field in AFQuery output means and how to interpret special cases.

## Output Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **AC** | int | Allele count — number of alt allele copies in eligible samples |
| **AN** | int | Allele number — total alleles examined (adjusted for ploidy and eligible samples) |
| **AF** | float | Allele frequency — `AC / AN`. `None` when AN=0 |
| **N_HET** | int | Number of eligible samples heterozygous for the alt allele (GT=0/1) |
| **N_HOM_ALT** | int | Number of eligible samples homozygous for the alt allele (GT=1/1 or GT=1). Includes haploid carriers on sex chromosomes and chrM. See [Ploidy](../advanced/ploidy-and-sex-chroms.md#genotype-counting). |
| **N_HOM_REF** | int | Number of eligible samples homozygous reference (GT=0/0 or GT=0) |
| **n_eligible** | int | Number of eligible samples — those passing the sex/phenotype/tech filters *and* covered at this position |
| **N_FAIL** | int | Number of eligible samples whose call at this position had FILTER≠PASS. These samples are counted *only* in N_FAIL — not in N_HET, N_HOM_ALT, or N_HOM_REF — but they stay eligible and still count toward AN. |
| **N_NO_COVERAGE** | int | Number of eligible samples whose tech lacks coverage evidence at this position. Excluded from `N_HOM_REF` to keep AC/AN conservative. Always `0` unless a coverage-evidence filter is active. See [Coverage Evidence](../advanced/coverage-evidence.md). |

## Special Cases

### AN=0 and AF=None

AN=0 means no eligible samples have coverage at this position. This happens when:

- All eligible samples are WES or panels and the position is outside capture regions
- The phenotype/sex/technology filter excludes all samples
- The chromosome is not in the database


!!! warning "AN=0 does not mean the variant is absent"
    AN=0 means AFQuery has no data to compute frequency. It is not evidence of rarity.

### Warnings

afquery emits a `AfqueryWarning` to stderr when a query may silently return fewer or no results. Common causes:

| Situation | Warning message |
|-----------|----------------|
| Chromosome not in database | `Chromosome 'chrXX' has no data in this database. Available: [...]` |
| Unknown phenotype code (include) | `Phenotype 'CODE' not in database — include will match 0 samples.` |
| Unknown phenotype code (exclude) | `Phenotype 'CODE' not in database — exclude has no effect.` |
| Unknown technology name (include) | `Technology 'NAME' not in database — include will match 0 samples.` |
| Unknown technology name (exclude) | `Technology 'NAME' not in database — exclude has no effect.` |
| Contradictory filters (e.g. include + exclude same code) | `Sample filter produces an empty eligible set — all queries will return AN=0.` |

Use `--no-warn` to suppress these warnings:

```bash
afquery query --db ./my_db/ --locus chr22:1000 --no-warn
afquery annotate --db ./my_db/ --input in.vcf --output out.vcf --no-warn
```

### AC=0 with High AN

AC=0 with a high AN (e.g., AN=4000) means the variant was **genuinely not observed** in a well-covered cohort. This is meaningful evidence that the variant is rare or absent in your population.


### N_FAIL > 0

When N_FAIL > 0, some eligible samples had a non-PASS filter at this position in their source VCF. A high N_FAIL relative to AN may indicate a problematic site (e.g., systematic sequencing artifacts). Consider filtering positions with more than 10% of failing (`N_FAIL / (AN / 2) > 0.1`).

## VCF Annotation Fields

When using `afquery annotate`, the following INFO fields are added to each variant:

| INFO field | Number | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `AFQUERY_AC` | A (per ALT) | Allele count — one value per ALT allele |
| `AFQUERY_AN` | 1 (per site) | Allele number — shared across all ALT alleles |
| `AFQUERY_AF` | A (per ALT) | Allele frequency — one value per ALT allele |
| `AFQUERY_N_HET` | A (per ALT) | Heterozygous sample count per ALT allele |
| `AFQUERY_N_HOM_ALT` | A (per ALT) | Homozygous alt sample count per ALT allele |
| `AFQUERY_N_HOM_REF` | A (per ALT) | Homozygous ref sample count per ALT allele |
| `AFQUERY_N_FAIL` | 1 (per site) | Fail sample count — shared across all ALT alleles |
| `AFQUERY_N_NO_COVERAGE` | A (per ALT) | Eligible samples whose tech lacks coverage evidence at this position. Always `0` unless a coverage-evidence filter is active. See [Coverage Evidence](../advanced/coverage-evidence.md). |

!!! note "Multi-allelic sites"
    Number=A fields have one value per ALT allele (comma-separated for multi-allelic sites). Number=1 fields are shared across all ALT alleles at the same position.

These fields can be used directly in downstream filtering with `bcftools filter`:

```bash
# Keep variants rare in cohort with sufficient coverage
bcftools filter -i 'AFQUERY_AF < 0.001 && AFQUERY_AN >= 1000' annotated.vcf.gz
```
